        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
        rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
        and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
        brackets.
